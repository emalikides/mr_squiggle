How do I convert a webcam image to black and white?
How do I transform a pixelated image to coordinates to be drawn by the thing??


Can I recognise without a transformation?
- for handwriting. yes with Neural Networks or transformation ind. features.

Example: completes lower half of face 
- Uses regression. Not really appropriate, but could be done for my problem.

How do I do recognition?
- Use something fast and shit, since accuracy is not important.
- KNN? What is the feature space?
- Neural network?

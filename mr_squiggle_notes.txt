TODO:
1. Convert webcam image to black and white
2. Recognise the image, and find the transform
3. Apply the transformation to library of drawing instructions.
4. Write code to create simple drawing instructions from a black and white
image.

Can I recognise without a transformation?
- for handwriting. yes with Neural Networks or transformation ind. features.

Example: completes lower half of face 
- Uses regression. Not really appropriate, but could be done for my problem.

How do I do recognition?
- Use something fast and shit, since accuracy is not important.
- KNN? What is the feature space?
- Neural network?
